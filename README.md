# Puma Scan Serverless Prey

Serverless Prey contains vulnerable serverless functions (FaaS) for GCP Functions, Azure Functions, and AWS Lambda.

The functions are launched into the environment. Using the functions, researchers can reverse engineer the execution environment, determine where secrets are stored, learn to extract data, and identify monitoring / incident response data points.
