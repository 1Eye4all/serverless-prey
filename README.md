# Puma Scan Serverless Prey

Serverless Prey is a collection of serverless functions (FaaS) for GCP Functions, Azure Functions, and AWS Lambda. Once launched to the environment and invoked, these functions establish a TCP reverse shell for the purposes of introspecting the container runtimes of the various function runtimes.

This repository also contains research performed using these functions, including documentation on where secrets are stored, how to extract sensitive data, and identify monitoring / incident response data points.
